# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a Weather app. Where I use Google Maps Api, OpenWeather Api. You can click on map and get this place weather

Your can also search City to Know weather and forecast.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
